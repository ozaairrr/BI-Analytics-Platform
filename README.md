## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Architecture

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Source Systems** | MySQL Database (2 schemas: gdb041 with 5 dimension/fact tables, gdb056 with 5 cost tables) |
| **Data Volume** | 5.3M+ transaction records spanning fiscal years 2018-2022 |
| **Dimensional Coverage** | 345 products, 209 customers, 27 markets/zones |
| **Data Schema** | Star schema with 10 interconnected tables (6 dimension + 4 fact) |
| **Refresh Strategy** | Hourly incremental loads via Power Query |

### Power Query ETL Transformations

**Date Table Creation:**
- Custom date range (Sep 2017 - Dec 2022) with continuous dates required for DAX time intelligence
- Fiscal year offset: `Date.Year(Date.AddMonths([month], 4))` to align with company's April-start fiscal calendar
- Quarterly and monthly rollups for hierarchical filtering

**Blending Actuals & Forecasts:**
- Created `lastSales_Month` query to identify data cutoff (Dec 1, 2021)
- Built `remainingforecast` table filtering forecasts after sales cutoff
- Appended sales and forecast tables into unified `fact_actuals_estimates` for seamless analysis
- Unified quantity column combines actual sales through Dec 2021 and forecasts for 2022

**Multi-Table Integration:**
- Performed left joins with 5 cost tables (gross_price, manufacturing_cost, freight_cost, pre_invoice_deduction, post_invoice_deduction) on product_code and fiscal_year
- Merged operational expense percentages (Ads, Promotions, Other) from Excel import
- Linked target data by date and market to support benchmark comparison

**Performance Optimization:**
- Disabled loads for 4 intermediate tables (gross_price, freight_cost, etc.) to reduce file bloat
- Selected only required columns in fact tables (date, product_code, customer_code, quantities)
- Removed derived columns from fact table; computed dynamically in DAX instead
- Result: **70MB file size reduction** while maintaining full analytical capability

**Quality Assurance:**
- Renamed and documented all query steps for maintainability
- Grouped related tables into logical sections
- Validated data against Project Owner benchmarks across all fiscal years

### Power BI Data Model

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Relationships** | 15 active relationships in star schema configuration |
| **Helper Tables** | Created DAX tables (fiscal_year, sub_zone, category) to resolve many-to-many relationships |
| **DAX Measures** | 40+ custom measures including P&L cascade, forecasting metrics, variance calculations |
| **Interactivity** | Cross-filtering, bookmarks for page navigation, tooltip pages with dynamic titles |
| **Performance** | Dashboard loads in <2 seconds with full filtering capability |

---

## 📊 Data Quality & Validation

**Benchmark Validation Against Project Owner Requirements:**

All data cross-checked using record counts and aggregations across fiscal years:

| Metric | FY 2018 | FY 2019 | FY 2020 | FY 2021 | FY 2022 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Total Sales Qty** | 3.45M ✓ | 10.78M ✓ | 20.77M ✓ | 50.16M ✓ | - |
| **Total Forecast Qty** | - | - | - | - | 86.82M ✓ |
| **Products Tracked** | - | - | - | - | 345 ✓ |
| **Active Customers** | - | - | - | - | 209 ✓ |
| **Markets/Zones** | - | - | - | - | 27 ✓ |

✅ Validation methodology: Record counts on all dimension and fact table columns matched PO benchmarks for accuracy verification.

## 🙌 What I Learned from This Project

**Key Technical Insights:**

1. **Data quality is the foundation** – Spent significant time on validation and cleaning; this prevents countless downstream errors
2. **DAX complexity requires careful architecture** – Complex nested formulas need robust error handling and performance considerations
3. **Business context drives design decisions** – Understanding the actual use case (YTD/YTG logic, fiscal year offset) is crucial for building relevant models
4. **Performance optimization is iterative** – File size reduction required multiple passes: column selection, removing derived columns, optimizing relationships
5. **Many-to-many relationships are complexity multipliers** – Proper dimensional design with helper tables prevents downstream issues
6. **Documentation is a strategic asset** – Clear formula naming and architecture documentation make dashboards maintainable and scalable
7. **User experience matters more than features** – Well-designed slicers and tooltips drive adoption more than additional charts
